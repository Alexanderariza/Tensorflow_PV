# Artificial intelligence (AI) with Tensorflow for PV monitoring
Artificial intelligence (AI) model using Tensorflow to automatically detect the progress of works in the execution of photovoltaic projects.

The model works from a series of images of rivers and roads preloaded on layers of [OPS](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/category/operations/) (openstreetmap), which serve to train a model of **[IA](https://towardsdatascience.com/search?q=Artificial%20inteligent)** which performs for each dataset an analysis on more than 10,000 images.  This allows to classify in real time the progress of the construction activities in 3 phases or stages of the PV photovoltaic project.
