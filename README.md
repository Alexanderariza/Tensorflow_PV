# Artificial intelligence (AI) with Tensorflow for PV monitoring
Artificial intelligence (AI) model using Tensorflow to automatically detect the progress of works in the execution of photovoltaic projects.

The model works from a series of images of rivers and roads preloaded on layers of [OPS](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/category/operations/) (openstreetmap), which serve to train a model of **[IA](https://towardsdatascience.com/search?q=Artificial%20inteligent)** which performs for each dataset an analysis on more than 10,000 images.

**60 cycles or epochs**, with iterations every **16 lots or images**, which allows you to classify images in tree phases or stages of the PV project:

## Parameters
**Learning rate** of = 0.00101
**Cycles or epochs** = 60 
**number of lots / images** = 16
